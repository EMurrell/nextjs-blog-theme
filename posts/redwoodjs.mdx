title: Why New Developers Should Learn RedwoodJS
description: 'Opinion'
---

With [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) and Headless
architecture gaining popularity among today’s developers, choosing which
technologies to integrate when building our apps can become tiresome and
repetitive. Then there's all that boilerplate involved in connecting all of the
pieces, from databases to third-party APIs to authorization... just scaffolding
a new project can be a project in and of itself.

Enter RedwoodJS, a highly opinionated "full-stack framework for startups" that
takes some of that boilerplate off our plate, and makes some of those
well-educated decisions for us. Drawing inspiration from frameworks such as Ruby
on Rails, Redwood believes there is “power in standards”, and implements a set
of conventions upon which to build our next project.

You may have heard the term "the future is serverless", and
[serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions)
are at the heart and center of Redwood’s architecture. RedwoodJS uses JavaScript
as its front AND backend language, and is powered by GraphQL and React. Interact
with your database through Prisma’s ORM, practice modern type safety with
optional Typescript support, and test your dataflow with Jest. Use Storybook to
build out your UI components in isolation.

## A Little History

RedwoodJS is built and maintained by some pretty big names in the world of
software. Among them is Github co-founder and creator of Jekyll,
[Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo). Its creators are “obsessed
with developer experience”, and it shows. I’ve personally worked on a few
Redwood-based projects, and have enjoyed it immensely. Even completing the
official tutorials provides one with a feeling of having learned something
powerful. Which brings us to…

## The Benefits of Learning RedwoodJS

For many new developers, the sheer volume of languages, frameworks and
technologies to chose from when defining your own personal “roadmap” can be
overwhelming. It's not uncommon for new developers to jump from language to
language in hopes of finding “the one that clicks”, and there are certainly a
vast plethora of options available.

When you build a project with Redwood (yes even just the tutorial), you’ll gain
a lot of transferable, practical knowledge along the way. Especially if you’re a
more frontend-inclined developer. The official tutorial is well-structured and
easy to follow.

Here’s a quick snapshot of some of those core technologies:

**React:** Without a doubt today’s most popular JavaScript library,

**GraphQL:** An open-source data querying language for manipulating APIs,

**Prisma:** A human-friendly, Node.js based ORM,

**Jest:** A zero-config JavaScript testing framework,

**Storybook:** The leading tool for developing UIs in isolation,

**Babel:** A backwards-compatible JavaScript compiler,

**Webpack:** Static module bundler for JS applications.

You probably recognize most (if not all) of these technologies. They are all
quite widely used today, and any developer would be well-suited to have at least
some working knowledge of each one.

## Conclusion

While completing a tutorial on a new framework won't make you an expert by any
means, it can definitely give you a clearer understanding of it. Learning a
little Redwood won't make you an authority on unit-testing or database
management. It can, however, provide you with some practical knowledge and
skills that can be applied toward other future software projects. Continuous
learning is, afterall, the cornerstone to any successful software developer's
career.
