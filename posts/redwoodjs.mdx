title: An Introduction to RedwoodJS
description: 'A full-stack framework for startups'

With the growing popularity of Jamstack architecture among today’s developers, choosing which technologies we integrate to build our apps can quickly become needlessly tiresome and repetitive. There’s also much boilerplate involved assembling all of the pieces, from databases to third-party APIs to authorization: just scaffolding a new project can be a project in and of itself.

Enter RedwoodJS, a highly opinionated Jamstack framework that takes some of that boilerplate off YOUR plate, and makes some of those well-educated decisions for you. Drawing inspiration from frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Redwood believes in the “power in standards”, and implements a set of conventions upon which to build your next project.

The future is serverless, and serverless functions are at the heart and center of Redwood’s architecture. RedwoodJS uses JavaScript as its front AND backend language, and is powered by GraphQL and React. Interact with your database through Prisma’s ORM, practice modern type safety with optional Typescript support, and test your dataflow with Jest. Use Storybook to build out your UI components in isolation.

## A Little History

RedwoodJS is built and maintained by some of the greats. Among them is Github co-founder and creator of Jekyll, Tom Preston-Werner. Its creators are “obsessed with developer experience” and it shows. I’ve personally worked on a few Redwood-based projects, and have enjoyed it immensely. Even completing the official tutorials provides one with a feeling of having learned something powerful. Which brings us to…

## The Benefits of Learning RedwoodJS

For many new developers, the sheer volume of languages, frameworks and technologies to chose from when defining your own personal “roadmap” can be overwhelming. I often see would-be junior developers jump from language to language in hopes of finding “the one that clicks”, perhaps in part due to the vast plethora of options, approaches and methodologies available.

When you build a project with Redwood (yes even just the tutorial), you’ll gain a lot of transferable, practical knowledge along the way. Especially if you’re one of those developers (myself included) who is more frontend-inclined.

Here’s a quick snapshot of some of those core technologies:

**React:** Without a doubt today’s most popular JavaScript library,

**GraphQL:** An open-source data querying language for manipulating APIs,

**Prisma:** A human-friendly, Node.js based ORM,

**Jest:** A zero-config JavaScript testing framework,

**Storybook:** The leading tool for developing UIs in isolation,

**Babel:** A backwards-compatible JavaScript compiler,

**Webpack:** Static module bundler for JS applications.

You probably recognize most (if not all) of these technologies. They are all quite widely used today, and any developer would be well-suited to have at least some working knowledge of each one. As for the official tutorial, it is well-structured and easy to follow.
